# Mixed radix incrementing algorithm

Many problems that require traversing all combinations of a given type that satisfy a number of conditions can be approached with a concept of going through numbers in some mixed radix numeral system. Incrementing (or decrementing) these numbers, subject to constraints, would then provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to generate all required combinations. 

For various versions of the algorithm, detailed description of the concept, and example problems, see mirsa.pdf.
